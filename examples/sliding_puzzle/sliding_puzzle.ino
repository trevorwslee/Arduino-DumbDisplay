/**
 * If BLUETOOTH is #defined, it uses ESP32 bluetooth connection
 * If WIFI_SSID is #defined, it uses wifi connection
 * Otherwise, it uses USB connection (OTG) with the default 115200 baud
 * To run and see the result of this sketch, you will need two addition things:
 * . you will need to install Android DumbDisplay app from Play store
 *   https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nobody.trevorlee.dumbdisplay
 * . although there are several ways for microcontroller board to establish connection
 *   with DumbDisplay app, here, the simple OTG USB connection is assume;
 *   hence, you will need an OTG adaptor cable for connecting your microcontroller board
 *   to your Android phone
 * . after uploading the sketch to your microcontroller board, plug the USB cable
 *   to the OTG adaptor connected to your Android phone
 * . open the DumbDisplay app and make connection to your microcontroller board via the USB cable;
 *   hopefully, the UI is obvious enough :)
 * . for more details on DumbDisplay Arduino Library, please refer to
 *   https://github.com/trevorwslee/Arduino-DumbDisplay#readme
 * There is a related blog post that you may want to take a look:
