Notes:

* GitHub repository for DumbDisplay Arduino Library is https://github.com/trevorwslee/Arduino-DumbDisplay

* The doc here is updated for v0.9.8-r7

* Other than reading the [README](https://github.com/trevorwslee/Arduino-DumbDisplay#readme) of the GitHub project, you might be kick-started with what described in [Blink Test With Virtual Display, DumbDisplay](https://www.instructables.com/Blink-Test-With-Virtual-Display-DumbDisplay/)

* Some little tips for reducing the library's footprint
  - if you will not be making use of "tunnel", define the compile-time macro `DD_NO_TUNNEL`
  - if you will not be making use of "feedback", define the compile-time macro `DD_NO_FEEDBACK`
  - if you will not be making use of "passive" connection, define the compile-time macro `DD_NO_PASSIVE_CONNECT` 

* ***Have Fun! Peace be with you! May God bless you! Jesus loves you!***
