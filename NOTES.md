Notes:

* The starting point is a [DumbDisplay](https://trevorwslee.github.io/ArduinoDumbDisplay/html/class_dumb_display.html) object

* The *README* of the [GitHub repository for DumbDisplay Arduino Library](https://github.com/trevorwslee/Arduino-DumbDisplay) should provide more details

* Other than reading the [*README*](https://github.com/trevorwslee/Arduino-DumbDisplay#readme), you might be kick-started with what described in [Blink Test With Virtual Display, DumbDisplay](https://www.instructables.com/Blink-Test-With-Virtual-Display-DumbDisplay/)

* Some little tips for reducing the library's footprint
  - if you will not be making use of "tunnel", define the compile-time macro `DD_NO_TUNNEL`
  - if you will not be making use of "feedback", define the compile-time macro `DD_NO_FEEDBACK`
  - if you will not be making use of "passive" connection, define the compile-time macro `DD_NO_PASSIVE_CONNECT` 

* ***Have Fun! Peace be with you! May God bless you! Jesus loves you! Amazing Grace!***
